## Practical work_1:
### 1. practical work. Objec-relational DB storage structures
Creation of object – relational database data storage structures and methods, data input, metadata output and data extraction (queries).
Deadline: 3. November. 2017

1. Creation of object table with row type objects. Input of data (INSERT). Output of metadata (SELECT), output of objects and its components (SELECT) using function Value(). Map or ORDER and MEMBER methods creation for row type objects. Queries with methods (min. 3).
2. Creation of one to many (1 : N) object relationship between relational table with object column and object table. Input of data. Input of object identifiers using function REF(). Data extraction (all objects and object components) using function DEREF().
3. Creation of object view with 2 methods from 2 tables (relational table and relational table with column objects). Realization of queries from object view (min. 2).
4. Creation of table with collection. For collection objects is created Member type method. Data input. Queries with method (min.2).
5. Creation of object type hierarchy (min. 4 object types) with methods. Creation of object table with different type of objects (according defined type hierarchy). Data input, queries with TREAT(), IS OF TYPE(), SYS_TTYPEID(). Realization of methods inheritance. Queries.
6. Conclusions.


## Practical work_2:
### 2. practical work. Use of Java in database server
In 2. practical work is discussed use of Java in database server. Deadline: 28. November.

1. Java class creation and loading in database:
1) using LOADJAVA program;
2) using CREATE JAVA command.
2. Java class meta-date inspection (SELECT).
3. Creation of PL/SQL function which call Java method. Execution of Java method.
4. Java class creation, loading and testing for SELECT and INSERT queries realization.
5. Conclusions (what seems good, what bad, what like, what is problematic).


## Practical work_3:
### 3. practical work. XML database
Design of XML database. Deadline: 19. December.

1. With XML editor (EditX, Oxygen, …) design and create XML documents and schema files.
2. Design and creation of XML database data storage object-relational tables with XMLType use:
– unstructured type (CLOB type);
– structured type (OR type);
– if You use Oracle12, binary type.
3. Perform input of data (as text and use bfile (directory creation and use of large object function bfile)).
4. Perform extraction of data (queries (4)) from tables.
5. Perform registration of schema.
6. Create table for structured type of storage with use of schema.
7. Perform 4 queries.
8. Perform queries:
– to achieve relational type of data from XML stored data;
– to achieve XML type of data from relational type of data.
9. Conclusions.
